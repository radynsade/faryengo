# Go

Go 1.26.

## Architecture

Follow [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for architectural decisions.
If guidance here conflicts with it, the architecture document takes precedence.

## Commands

- Everything: `make check`  (gofmt, go vet, golangci-lint, go test -race)
- Test:       `go test -race -count=1 -timeout 60s ./...`
- One test:   `go test -run TestName ./internal/pkg -v`
- Bench:      `go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/pkg`

`-race` is always on and `-count=1` disables caching. Do not remove either to
make the suite faster.

## Errors

- Wrap with context and %w: `fmt.Errorf("load user %s: %w", id, err)`.
  Never %v — it silently breaks errors.Is for every caller.
- Compare with errors.Is / errors.As, never ==.
- Handle once: add context and return. Do not log and return the same error.
- No naked returns. No panic outside main() and package init.

## Concurrency

- Every goroutine needs a guaranteed exit path. If it can block on a send,
  buffer the channel or give it a context.
- Prefer errgroup.WithContext over WaitGroup + channels by hand.
- context.Context is the first parameter of anything doing I/O, and is
  actually plumbed through — not accepted and dropped.
- TestMain calls goleak.VerifyTestMain.
- Never range a map to produce output. Sort the keys.

## Style the linter cannot enforce

- Interfaces are declared by the CONSUMER, in the consumer's package, and are
  small. One or two methods. Return concrete types.
- Table-driven tests with t.Run subtests.
- Use the current stdlib: os.ReadFile not ioutil, any not interface{},
  slices/maps packages, log/slog not logrus, math/rand/v2.
- No dependency injection framework. Wire it explicitly in main().
- Put a blank line between multiline operations (statements ending in `;`) at
  the same indentation level.
- Separate control-flow statements (`if`, `for`, `switch`, `select`, etc.) from
  nearby statements with blank lines when they are at the same indentation level.
- Avoid early returns; prefer explicit control flow.

## Landmines

- internal/scheduler is leader-elected. Changing tick timing needs an ops review.
- internal/proto is generated. Edit the .proto and run `make proto`.
- cmd/migrate: write migrations, never run them. A human runs migrations.
